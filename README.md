# Simple-Blackjack
 Blackjack game in Python.

To run the program you just need to do `python simple_blackjack.py`.

To test the program I have created a separate file that lets you chose your initial hand and any new card you draw to test all the different scenarios. To run the test file, modify your initial hand at the bottom of the file and then just do `python simple_blackjack_test.py`.

I am using Python version 3.7.
